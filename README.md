# OOPS-Banner-App# OOPS-Banner-App

## Description
This Java application renders the text "OOPS" in various formats, including standard console output and large ASCII banners. It was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming lab at **SRMIST**.

## Use Cases
* **UC1:** Prints "OOPS" directly to the console.
* **UC2:** Renders "OOPS" as a multi-line banner using print statements.

## Workflow & Git Strategy
This project follows a professional branching model to ensure code stability:
1. **Feature Branches:** Individual tasks (UC1, UC2) were developed on separate branches.
2. **Development Branch (`dev`):** Feature branches were merged here for testing.
3. **Main Branch (`main`):** The final stable version was released and tagged as `v1.0`.

## Setup & Usage
1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Abhijeet6080/OOPS-Banner-App.git`.
3. Compile: `javac BannerApp.java`.
